# 🚀 Static Website Deployment – Cloud Capstone Project

This project showcases the deployment of a **static website** on an **AWS EC2 instance** using **NGINX** and automated Bash scripting. It was completed as part of my Cloud Computing Capstone at **Techcrush Bootcamp**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build and deploy a static portfolio website on a cloud platform (AWS EC2), demonstrating core cloud concepts like:

- Linux server provisioning
- Web server configuration (NGINX)
- Secure SSH access
- Infrastructure automation with Bash
- GitHub-based version control and CI/CD (bonus)

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Amazon EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04)**
- **NGINX** – Web Server
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**
- **Bash scripting** – for automated deployment
- **Git & GitHub**
- **GitHub Actions** (optional CI/CD)

---

## 🧪 What I Did

✅ Provisioned a new EC2 Ubuntu server  
✅ Installed and configured NGINX  
✅ Created a portfolio-style website (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)  
✅ Wrote a full Bash script (`deploy.sh`) to automate the entire setup  
✅ Pushed all project files to GitHub for version control  
✅ (Optional) Setup GitHub Actions for continuous deployment
